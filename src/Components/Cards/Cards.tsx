          Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you and welcome you to my portfolio as
          a software developer. I would like to tell you a little about myself.
          I am a software engineering student, I have excelled in full stack
          projects creating complete applications, I have experience in agile
          methodologies such as Scrum and Kamban. Despite being able to create
          complete applications, my greatest passion is in Backend development
          and databases. I love Machine learning , deep learning and all topics
          about data science.
